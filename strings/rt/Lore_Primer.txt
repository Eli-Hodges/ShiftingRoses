		<summary><strong> Solaros' Grand Domain </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Suns Own</em>
		<br><br>
		Located in the southern part of Hearthshire, Solaros' Grand Domain is arguably the single most powerful political entity in the known world. Almost all peoples use the Solar Calendar, canonized by the Sunlight Temple during the year 0SC, and it maintains a strong relationship with the Siluchi City States to allow a strong grip on trading. The people of Solaros' Grand Domain are known to be steadfast, loyal, and deeply faithful to their patrons and their people. It is one of the most diverse factions within the Three Continents, and in spite of being founded by Humans during the times before the Solar Calender, Humans no longer remain the majority figure within the Domain. Its notable tolerance towards all people of all walks of life, and good standard of living for even the lowest class, makes it the most popular migrational destination to anyone seeking a new life. With the end of the Fourth Solarian/Grenzelhoftian War, Solaros' Grand Domain found itself rebuilding most of its more northern territories, a process which has taken up most of its concerns for the past few years.
		<br><br>
		The Grand Domain's prominence was built from tactical allyship, and a willingness to embrace industrialization. Through close cooperation with Stonekeep, railways have connected almost the entirety of Grand Domain lands to one another, allowing for unprecedented connection and reach between its peoples. It holds both a deep friendship with the Dwarves of Stonekeep, and additional friendship with many of the Isle City States. Its main god is Sol, but worship of every diety of the Pantheon is welcomed within the Domain. Its capital is located within the shores of the Bay of Stars. People from Solaros' Grand Domain are generally called Solaros' People, or Domainers.
		<br><br>

	<details>
		<summary><strong> Siluchi City States </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>Land of Riches, the Isle City States, the Pulse of the Continents</em>
		<br><br>
		The Siluchi City States are not a single political entity, but rather a collection of independent republics which span the large islands broken off from the Bay of Stars, in what many believe to have been a star landing upon Terra some thousands of years ago. These republics, while nominally working together with one another, have had their fair share of spats, skirmishes, and otherwise blood disagreements in the many years of their existence. However no quarrel lasts long, and the City States are broadly considered to be a single entity within the political spectrum. Many isles with which the city states reside rest in the center of the straits which seperate the three continents. This has made the City States the global center for trade and commerce between all factions, while also making it a cultural, intellectual, and artistic powerhouse. In recent years, the founding of the 'Triumvirate Pantheon' to canonize all of the major religions of the Three Continents together has centered from the City States.
		<br><br>
		The City States have had the good fortune of being able to profit off of nearby wars without ever taking part of them due to their impressive array of Mercenaries. All City States field a number of Pavise Crossbowmen, which have long been a staple purchase for Domainer Armies seeking to augment their ranged capabilities. Espardo Duelists, Silucian Sergeants, and Veronian Montate are all hired individually as bodyguards or as small groups to augment armies. There is no singular god worshiped above any other within the City States. People from the City States are usually called City Staters, Statesmen, or Republicans. Some may also be called by their individual City State name, such as Esparian, Deonian, or Veronian.

		<summary><strong> Grenzelhoft Empire </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Black Empire, The Empty Throne, Empire of War</em>
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoft is an imperialist state carved across the center of Hearthshire, from coast to coast. Its founding is shrouded in mystery, and nobody knows the true story of what brought about the Black Empire. What isn't under doubt however, is the sheer force of might Grenzelhoft fields within its lands. Grenzelhoft is a military empire where the rule is passed down not to sons or daughters, but to the General most deserving to oversee the Empire. All individuals who come of age are required to spend at least two years in service of either their local county militia, or within one of its many Free Companies. This has led Grenzelhoft to field the largest and most professional armies within the world, having defeated every neighbor they have at least once prior, including the Dukedom of Camrey, the Kingdom of Helmsmore, and Solaros' Grand Domain.
		<br><br>
		Grenzelhoftians proudly assimilate all willing to come and serve, cultures and religions mean little to the Black Empire besides your physical capabilites. Founders of what is known as the 'Hearthshire Pantheon', Grenzelhoft is a cultural centerpiece of Hearthshire, which puts it consistently at odds with Solaros' Grand Domain. Most other Pantheons are frowned upon, and Kerack worshipers are put to death on the spot. Besides that, with a blade in your hand you'll be welcome to the Grenzelhoftian cause. Their history is defined by war, death, and destruction, for their armies are known to give no mercy. Ilia, Goddess of War and Fertility, is the centerpiece of their religious Pantheon.
		<br><br>
		With the end of the 4th Solarian/Grenzelhoftian war, Grenzelhoft has had been rebuilding some of its southern territories, and recovering from the loss of their Emperor and many of their highest generals due to the last battle of the war, which saw them wiped from the fields of the Grand Domain by an inferior force due to tactics never seen before. While the war was generally considered a stalemate, the bitter sting of the final defeat hasn't left the hearts of the nobility, and while most of the Free Companies move to offer their services as Mercenaries elsewhere, some consider it only a matter of time before war falls upon the Black Empire once more.

		<summary><strong> Wilusian Dynasty </strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>The Breadbasket of Alur, Empire of the Rivers, Merchants of the Pasha</em>
		<br><br>
		A grand-spanning, mercantilist empire which found prosperity and riches from both spice and food, Wilusia is effectively the homeplace of Humans as the world knows it. Residing almost entirely within the confines of the Torki River's wide reach there could be no more suitable a place to live than the most fertile lands in the known world. Wilusia was founded by a coalition of Humans, Rakshari, and Tieflings after a two hundred year war saw the greatest exile of peoples the world had ever seen, well before the Solar Calendar was even made. Within their land lies great feats of engineering, and grand artistic displays prominently shown within any of its myriad of villages and towns along the river. Their capital is the centerpiece of Wilusian worship of what is known as the Wilusian Pantheon, worshiping the stars in the skies as dieties which watch over the Wilusian peoples.
		<br><br>
		Wilusia has suffered repeated attempts by others, namely Grenzelhoft and the Grand Domain, to conquer its lands and aquire its many riches and materials, yet no exterior force has ever been able to defeat its capital, Fenkhu. In one particular instance, Grenzelhoft put Fenkhu to siege for seven years before they were routed at sea. In spite of City State mercenaries having been a part of many of these wars, Wilusia maintains good relations with the City States, whom are their main middle man to the wider Hearthshire kingdoms.
		<br><br>
		In spite of the Wilusian Pantheon being their primary religion, Terra worship is approved and the recent introduction of the 'Triumvirate' Pantheon has been generally well received. Predominantly a Human Empire, it is no less home to just about every race in the known world, including the largest gatherings of Tieflings. While known for its vast lands and many villages, it is also known to allow for legal slavery, albeit this practice is not widely used within its cities and is generally left mostly to the smaller villages. It is seen mostly as either a punishment for a crime, or as a means to payback debt. People from the Wilusian Dynasty are simply known as Wilusians.

		<summary><strong> The Ogri Union</strong></summary>
		<br>
		<em>Union of the Plains, Gendeni's Own, Those in Graggars Shadows</em>
		<br><br>
		The Ogri Union is a coalition consisting of tribes of Orcs, Goblins, and Plains Dwarves who formed together after the ascension of Graggar. The devastation left behind by the god deeply shook the faith of the once proudly worshiping Orcish peoples, and a massive civil war saw the destruction of almost half of the Orcish and Goblin tribes. In the ashes of what was the most violent war on the continent, a Warlord and the tribes under her sought to rebuild their lands from the ground up to ensure that an ascension in the likes of Graggar never happened again. Aided by the Plains Dwarves, and an Adventurer from the City States who would come to have a profound impact on the future government the new Union would become, the Orcs and Goblins salvaged their ravaged lands and turned it into a prosperous empire.
		<br><br>
		The Orgi Union is governed by a council of representatives voted upon by each town, village, and city among the plains, who all get one represenative to have a seat on the council. The council then votes upon a Chieftain who is broadly a figurehead for the people of the Union. The Ogri Union is most notable for having no real commerce outside of interactions with other empires, as Food, Water, and Shelter are regarded as basic rights for all peoples. All transactions are either barters, favors, or simply good deeds done to assist in one another.
		<br><br>
		The people of the Ogri union mainly consist of Orcs, Goblins, Plains Dwarves, and Harpies, with very few peoples otherwise. They are unique for using blimps and zeppelins to navigate the immensely harsh terrain of the Denor Plains. Ever since the ascension of Graggar, many have rejected gods as worthy of worship, and thus Terran Worship is the major religion within the Union. The Triumvirate Pantheon holds no sway within Ogri lands, and secret Graggar cults still reside within the plains. People from the Ogri Union are usually just called by their race, but some people call them Plainsmen, Ogrians, or Unioners.

In spite of their smaller size compared to all of their neighbors, their capital of Rosewood is one of the most technologically advanced places in the world, eclipsing even that of Solaros' Grand Domain.

The Dukedom is ruled by a council of every single Duke within the lands, albeit this council can vary greatly as noble families rise and fall, and an exact count is never truly gleaned between meetings. They maintain a strict serfdom over their peoples in what looks like sheer slavery to most outsiders.

Their technological advancements have paved the way for many new inventions, and their close friendship with Solaros' Grand Domain has brought them into conflict with other Empires at multiple points. They've constructed most of the underground railways connecting most of Subterra, albeit their attempts to build them connecting to other continents have been thwarted by the Dark Elves, their greatest rivals. Their largest railway spans from Stonekeep in Southern Hearthshire, to Rosewood in Northern Heartshire. Malum is their god of worship.

		While a majority of Elves live alongside Humans and Dwarves in Hearthshire, some Elven Kingdoms reside within the forests on Alur. Living side by side with the Tribal People of the forests, the Elven Kingdoms are mostly self-sufficent and reclusive, preferring to live in peace rather than deal with the exterior issues which plague other lands. Some of these minor kingdoms are inherently mistrusting of outsiders, while others are much more receptive. Traditional Terra Worship is the primary worship of these Elves, and they violently reject any ascendant god.

		<summary><strong> Traditional Terra Worship </strong></summary>
		<br>
		What is widely regarded as the most widespread religion outside of the Trimvirate Pantheon, Terra Worship is a form of Animism focused on the idea that every living thing has a soul with which faith and power can be drawn from. Worshipers of this religion hold a deep respect for life, and most do not regard Gods as anything beyond what a mere mortal could achive.

		While Traditional Terra Worshipers do not believe in the Gods' power, some take a much more radical approach, and instead believe that all gods are inherently people whose souls became powerful enough to ascent. This is believe to have stemmed from Graggars Ascension, albeit Kerack's Ascension in Hearthmore also played a part in its spread.

		<br><br>
		Kerack never made it to the capital, as during a battle it is said that the mans sheer hatred for his enemies caused his near ascension before Ilia's arrow fell from the sky and peirced his heart. However it became apparent that the man was a heartless being, and his ascension marked the complete destruction of both his and Grenzelhofts armies, a memory which has left its scar on Grenzelhoft lands to this day.

		Keracks followers are bloodthirsty warriors who find strength only in combat and murder. It is unlikely for any two followers of the God of Hatred to get along for long, and cults are immensely rare albeit do happen on occasion. Kerack worshipers are violently hunted down by Grenzelhoftians.

		<br>
		Humanity is a broad race of peoples which span across all three of the known continents, and whose nature is never singularly predictable. Humans come from from all walks of life and seemingly in all shapes and sizes, and are broadly considered the single most populus race spanning the world. The wide variety of cultures which have stemmed from Human settlement and intervention has had the widest effect on the world and all political happenings upon it. Humans are as quick to courage and bravery as they are to fear and cowardice, and as easy to honesty and good just as they are to evil and violence. To try and define a human under a singular umbrella would be a fools effort. Solaros' Grand Domain, Grenzelhoft, The City States, and Wilusia are all majority Human political entities, with the Dukedom of Crechy and Helmsmore also being almost entirely Human.

		Elves have long been known to have come from the southern forests of Alur, and while at first glance many would be quick to compare them to Humans, they are far more different than meets the eye. Tall, lithe, and graceful, Elven people are longer lived than any other race in the known world. Their culture has revolved entirely around their immensely long lives, and most Elven people from the forests tend to regard others with an aloof nature. Elven people who migrated to other places, notably Solaros' Grand Domain, are much more sociable towards their fellow peoples. Their tall stature and flexible form has made many an Elven Blademaster a legend within Hearthshire. With a large population within Solaros' Grand Domain, and sizable populations within the City States and Wilusia, their prominence on the global stage is arguably matched only by Humans and Orcs.

They stand on average a foot and a half shorter than the average Human, but are no less stronger than them due to having slightly denser muscle mass. They are known as both hardy peoples and immensely knowledgable individuals who are quick to take upon them new teachings. Gnomish people outside of the mountains primarily reside within the Siluchi City States, where they are the second most populus race besides Humans. There is also a sizable group living within Rosewood in Helmsmore.

Prairie Dwarves are immensely hardy, capable of eating any manner of plant or mushroom without any negative effect and seemingly shrugging off painful blows with ease, but are not known to be quick. They are culturally inclined to take their time and never find themselves rushing anything, and while others might consider them lazy because of that it beguiles the truth of an immensely hard working people who have been the cornerstone of Ogri Union workforces since its inception. They stand on average just about four and a half feet, with sun-baked skin tones and either brown or amber hair colors, which are their main differentiating factors between them and Mountain Dwarves.

Lean builds and swift reflexes are what many know the Rakshari people for, yet many are unaware of the surprising strength that they are capable of mustering. Rakshari people were one of the founding cultures of Wilusia, alongside the Uthician Humans and a large gathering of Tieflings. Direct, to the point, and not people who enjoy mincing words, a staple of Wilusian Rakshari is their intense eye contact with anyone with whom they make dealings with, a fact which many a Merchant Prince of the City States has come to practice for before making deals with Rakshari. The Rakshari people stand on average just above five feet, yet many are just as tall if not taller than Humans and even Elves. A race of almost no sexual dimorphism, voice is the main way one tends to learn about a Rakshari's gender.

		<br>
		Orcs are a race of green skined humanoid people whose ancestry is said to revolve around the folktale of the Denor Plains. Claimed to have been the largest forest in the known world, a massive earthquake split the roots of the forest and upended the land such that the forest was shattered after five days of the earth falling out from under it. Rather than die, the trees took form and became the Orcish people. Standing at slightly taller than the average Human, but shorter than an Elf, Orcish people are easily identified by their leaf-green or bark-brown like skin colors and hair colors, as well as jutting tusk like teeth. For most of their history they've been a savage people thanks in no small part to the dangerous lands they inherited from the earthquake. Yet in recent years their culture has shifted drastically, and they now are the heads of what is arguably the biggest democratic entity in the known world. Orcs rarely exist outside of the Ogri Union, and if they do they are probably adventurers or explorers. A small community exists within one of the City States, but mostly for diplomatic reasons.

		<br>
		Sharing the same ancestral story as Orcs, Goblins have been said Orc's best friends since their first inception. The truth of that statement is much more dubious. Their short stature compared to Orcs led them in the early days to effectively be the slaves of Orcs in some clans, while other clans treated them as equals. After Graggars ascension and the rise of the Ogri Union, Goblins found themselves truly an equal and friend to the Orcish people. Standing at barely four feet tall at the tallest, Goblins share the Orcs' green and brown skin tones while also sporting an impressive aray of hair colors. Purple, orange, and blue are not uncommon for Goblin peoples to have. Known to be quick witted, agile, and arguably a bit devious, Goblins exist much more numerously outside of the Ogri Union and are many peoples first introduction to the Union itself.

		<summary><strong> Mountain Dwarves </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Hailing from the mountain ranges in the eastern parts of Hearthshire, Mountain Dwarves, in their own words, were born from the energy which came from Malum falling from the sky and striking the earth. His energy uplifted the ground into the massive mountains, and from the stones were born the Mountain Dwarves. In spite of sharing a name, Mountain Dwarves share no similarity to Prairie Dwarves. Mountain Dwarves are always working, and always trying to get everything done as soon as possible. Idle hands are ill-advised within Mountain Dwarves' culture, as Malum does not look favorably upon those who would sit by while their brothers and sisters would toil away. Mountain Dwarves stand at four and half feet, and can usually be easily indentified by their sometimes blueish or greyish skin tones if not their stature alone. Some Mountain Dwarves do have more creamy skin tones to them, mostly if they find themselves living outside of the mountains for a long period of time.

		<summary><strong> Medicators </strong></summary>
		<br>
		The history of Medicators goes back to the explorations into the Shattered Isles in the east of Alur, where some claim that an ancient Empire of Clockwork and Magic had ruled the known world. Very few people were ever capable of surviving such a place, and those who returned spoke of strange bird like people seemingly riddled with all manner of pox and disease yet fully sapient and immensely talented in medical arts. It was not until a Gnomish expedition was able to confirm that these Medicators were real that many started to understand their nature. Initially believed to be some sort of Soultouched, recent studies have confirmed that Medicators are born from the sludge and waste the fallen empire left behind, making them Terran in nature. They strike a gaunt appearance, with long corvid like beaks and darkened feathers along their pox ridden body. While generally considered unsightly by many who first come into contact with them, this has not stopped the Medicator peoples from striking out to explore a world they've known existed but never knew held anything but empty wildlands. With a strikingly cold demeanor, whether by choice or by nature, Medicators take little care to how those around them perceive them and simply explore the world at their own pace. Knowledge of their culture within the Shattered Lands is immensely sparse, as Medicators themselves aren't completely sure of their own origins. They've known only the sludge pollution of their homeland and not where it originated from.

Broadly build fish-like peoples hailing from the Oceans far beyond the Straits of the Three Continents, Triton Tribes mainly avoid getting close to land if at all possible. Only two Tribes of Tritons reside within the Straits, names incomprehensible to normal tounge, and which scholars have taken to calling the Star-Bay Tribe and the Western Straits Tribe. What little is known of their culture comes only from the two tribes willing to live within the Straits, and even then it is known to be different from the Tritons which reside in the darkest depths of the oceans. Tritons are nominally tall individuals, with an extreme sexual dimorphism liking them to the Amazonian people. Women are notably bigger than their male counterparts, such that it affects their cultural identity. Tritons are well versed in seafaring; an obvious fact which has led them to become well sought after mercenaries and guides for traders and navies. Legends say that Triton come from sailors who tried to cross the sea but failed, forced to live off of the ocean until their offspring became better suited for water, a history which Tritons have come to neither confirm nor deny.

		<br>
		Hollowkin cover a broad range of tribal peoples and species which are said to all share the similar trait of having had their soul changed in some way thanks to the spirits of nature which reside within the world itself. Calling one a Hollowkin can do little to narrow down just what they may look like or who they may be. A Hollowkin could look almost entirely identical to some wildlife animal standing on two legs, or could simply have some manner of tail or ears. The history of each individual Hollowkin can vary greatly. Some tribal people communed with spirits so deeply that their children began to be born taking the traits of the spirits around them, whereas some others might claim they were experimented on by people seeking to better understand the nature of souls. Others simply do not know, or do not care. Hollowkin are not a unified people, and exist on all three continents in some way or another, leading them to easily intermix into whatever culture or peoples would take them. Hollowkin tribes also dot the lands south of Alur, especially near the southern edges of Wilusia's borders.

They are a hardy race of bipedal reptilian individuals who reside solely within the southeastern swamplands of Alur just before the Shattered Isles. Their discovery was an accident when an expedition into the Shattered Isles misread the map and went too far southwards. Lizardfolk have generally kept to themselves, yet the past twenty years has seen a large uptick in wandering Lizardfolk keen on exploring the world, which some may attribute to overpopulation within the swamplands. Lizardfolk in spite of their intimidating appearances have been known to be impressively amicable and sociable for complete strangers to the cultures outside of their own, and have rarely had problems integrating themselves with others. While some have speculated they may be related to Kobolds in some way, this theory has been proven false by Helmsmorian Scholars.

		The offspring of Zizo's ascension, Drows are a subspecies of Elves who resided within the Subterran for countless years. According to Elven history, they are the losers of a civil war which sought to ascend a god to power to conquer the world before the rise of other Kingdoms. In the end, these Elves fled to the Subterran, and would achive their goals in their own way. Yet an ascension does not come without significant cost. Their numbers dwindelled, and a goddess' ascension left those in the aftermatch changed to their very soul. With deep purple to almost blackish skin, immensely tall stature and intimidating gazes, Drows of the Subterran Kingdom are combine Elven grace and lethality with ruthlessness and ferocity that has made them the most feared race in the Three Continents. In spite of their souls having been altered by Zizo's ascension, it is known that Drow are not by their nature prone to such vile acts, given the few Drow who join with the peoples above are not the violent socipathic peoples that some claim they are. Yet still their kind is seen as untrustworthy by many, especially the Ogri Union, who have long had to deal with raids from Subterra stealing civilians to be used as slaves.

		The prime example of Soultouched peoples, and whom the name is based off of, Aasimar are individuals who are quite literally touched by gods at birth. The nature of this gift is different depending on the deities whom bless them. Most Wilusian deities may shine brightly upon their chosen from the night sky, giving Wilusian Aasimar the appearance of a starry and almost otherworldly being, albeit not all Wilusian Aasimar share this appearance. Sol meanwhile, gives their champions peircing gazes and blazing orange hair that seems always alight with flames. Hearthshire's deities vary greatly between gods, and come down simply to what domain the god themselves rules over. Whatever the case is, Aasimar are people looked upon with wonder and amazement by many, and were the original beings who were believed to be capable of ascension before the Elven Theory of Ascension spread throughout the world. Aasimar are usually well tended to from birth, rarely ever being shunned. All Aasimar born in Solaros' Grand Domain are immediately given the most wealthy upbringing possible to appease Sol.

		<summary><strong> Teiflings </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Tieflings are an alltogether unusual, and seemingly otherworldly race of peoples with wide horns, blue or red skin, and a seeming connection to elemental magics. While they appear to share as much in common as that as your average Human with the other races of the world, their origin is a complete mystery. Such is the heatedness of scholarly debate around them that it has been known that scholars have had honorable duels on University grounds within the City States over just what to call Tieflings. No connection has been made to any animals they could have evolved from, there's no proof they were born from any natural entity such as trees or rocks, and souls couldnt possibly have changed them into what they are. Worst of all, even Tieflings themselves do not know, nor are interested in sharing. As far as many are concerned, they were here since anyone else was here. Irregardless of their unknown origins, Tieflings have become a staple within soceities across the Three Continents, namely in Wilusia where they make up a significant population within the capital.

		<summary><strong> Kobolds </strong></summary>
		<br>
		Short statured lizard like beings, Kobolds have lived on the Three Continents for years and their existence still perplexes all manner of scholars. Their dimunative nature and lack of centralizing culture have left many of them in the services of Dragons and other creatures, and for all intents and purposes they have never had any manner of civilization or even gathering. The fact that they have existed for so long and have not either formed some sort of cultural entity or been wiped out is testament to either their sheer luck or sheer robustness. They have no recorded history and nobody know exactly where they even came from. Some believed they were related to Lizardfolk, but that was proven false, and their relations to Hollowkin are not such that scholars can agree that they are even a type of Hollowkin. In spite of all of this, Kobolds are a uniquely welcomed sight in civilized society due to their eagerly helpful nature, and seemingly endless willingness to learn. On the opposite hand, wild kobolds serving monsters are devious beings who will gladly do anything to garner an advantage in a fight, quick to flee when numbers are not on their size. They stand about as tall as a Gnome or Dwarf, albeit normally look shorter due to hunching slightly, and they are known to come in all different colors.
